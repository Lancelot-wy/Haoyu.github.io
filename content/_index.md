        I’m a research scientist focusing on AI Security at the intersection of large model vulnerabilities, backdoor attacks, and cybersecurity. My research leverages both qualitative and quantitative approaches to thoroughly examine the role of AI in ensuring secure and trustworthy systems. As AI continues to evolve, I aim to understand and mitigate the potential risks posed by adversarial and backdoor attacks in large-scale models, ensuring their resilience in real-world applications.
