ABSTRACT = {The accurate prevention and control of pear tree diseases, especially the precise segmentation of leaf diseases, poses a serious challenge to fruit farmers globally. Given the possibility of disease areas being minute with ambiguous boundaries, accurate segmentation becomes difficult. In this study, we propose a pear leaf disease segmentation model named MFBP-UNet. It is based on the UNet network architecture and integrates a Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE) module and a Tokenized Multilayer Perceptron (BATok-MLP) module with dynamic sparse attention. The MFE enhances the extraction of detail and semantic features, while the BATok-MLP successfully fuses regional and global attention, striking an effective balance in the extraction capabilities of both global and local information. Additionally, we pioneered the use of a diffusion model for data augmentation. By integrating and analyzing different augmentation methods, we further improved the model’s training accuracy and robustness. Experimental results reveal that, compared to other segmentation networks, MFBP-UNet shows a significant improvement across all performance metrics. Specifically, MFBP-UNet achieves scores of 86.15%, 93.53%, 90.89%, and 0.922 on MIoU, MP, MPA, and Dice metrics, marking respective improvements of 5.75%, 5.79%, 1.08%, and 0.074 over the UNet model. These results demonstrate the MFBP-UNet model’s superior performance and generalization capabilities in pear leaf disease segmentation and its inherent potential to address analogous challenges in natural environment segmentation tasks.},
